Windows user please checkout [this page](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/build#windows_environment_setup), to see how you can install this tool.

To build a project just **cd** to the project and run make:
```
 [~]cd projects/lan/kcu_105
 [~]make
```

2. In SDK file/new/project -> specify name, next -> empty application -> finish

3. –êdd sw_src/src files to your project.
